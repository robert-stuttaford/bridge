# ADR 001 --> Make Small Decisions

## Context



## Decision

Ask the user to commit to as little as possible, in any given interaction.

When creating a new entity, capture only enough information to create a valid entity. If possible, infer sensible default values for mandatory fields from these initial data. Defer capture of optional data to the edit process.

Rather than submitting changes all the fields for a given entity, edit and submit the changes one by one.

## Status

Accepted.

## Consequences
